#Web Scraper with python

This project involved building a fully functioning spider through Scrapy.
The spider successfully scraped over 900 book titles from a website.
The spider has been configured to run on both Fake User Agents as well as Proxy APIs.
All code here was for learning and Practise purposes and all API keys have since been rendered inactive hence configure the project to your specific needs.
